# SimpleMathTestGenerator
This class is designed to create a math test with certain sections for specific arithmetic operations like division, multiplication, addition, and even subtraction.

Each section has its score to determine the proficiency level and notify the user as to which operations to work on. 
Note: The variables can be changed in the class's constructor by altering the number of problems for each category.
